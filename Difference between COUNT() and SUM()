🧠 WHAT ARE THEY?
Function	What it Does
COUNT(expr)	Counts how many non-NULL values are present
SUM(expr)	Adds up (sums) numerical values, including 0
🧩 BASIC DIFFERENCE
Feature	COUNT	SUM
Purpose	Count how many rows match	Add the values of a column
Works on	Any column or expression	Numeric columns only
Ignores NULLs	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Counts 0 values?	✅ Yes (0 is not NULL)	✅ Yes (adds 0)
Default Aggregation	Number of items	Total of numeric values
📘 SIMPLE EXAMPLES

Assume a table called Orders:
order_id	amount	status
1	100	approved
2	200	declined
3	NULL	approved
4	0	declined
5	300	approved
Example 1: Counting rows

SELECT COUNT(amount) AS total_count FROM Orders;
-- Output: 4
-- NULL is ignored

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM Orders;
-- Output: 5
-- Counts all rows, even NULLs

Example 2: Summing values

SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_amount FROM Orders;
-- Output: 600 (100 + 200 + 0 + 300) → NULL ignored

🎯 WHEN TO USE WHAT?
Use Case	Use COUNT()	Use SUM()
How many orders placed?	✅	❌
What is total revenue?	❌	✅
How many approved orders?	✅ With CASE	❌ Use only if you want to total 1s
How many users failed login?	✅ With filter	❌
Total number of items sold	❌	✅
🧪 ADVANCED EXAMPLES WITH CASE
✅ Using COUNT with condition:

Count only approved orders:

SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'approved' THEN 1 END) AS approved_count
FROM Orders;
-- Output: 3 (orders 1, 3, 5)

✅ Using SUM with condition:

Count approved using SUM:

SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_count
FROM Orders;
-- Output: 3

    Both approaches are valid. Use whichever is easier to understand.

📦 Real-World Example

Imagine you're analyzing employee timesheets:
emp_id	hours_worked
1	8
2	7
3	NULL
4	0
5	9
Use COUNT(hours_worked):

-- How many employees logged hours?
SELECT COUNT(hours_worked) FROM timesheets;
-- Output: 4 (ignores NULL)

Use SUM(hours_worked):

-- What is the total hours worked?
SELECT SUM(hours_worked) FROM timesheets;
-- Output: 24 (8 + 7 + 0 + 9)

📌 KEY THINGS TO REMEMBER

    COUNT(*) counts all rows, including NULLs.

    COUNT(column) counts non-NULL values in that column.

    SUM(column) adds up numbers, ignores NULLs, includes 0.

    SUM(CASE WHEN...) is great for counting with logic (acts like a conditional counter).

    Don’t use COUNT(CASE... ELSE 0) — it counts everything (even 0s).

✅ QUICK RECAP TABLE
Example	COUNT() Result	SUM() Result
0	✅ Counted	✅ Added
NULL	❌ Not Counted	❌ Ignored
5	✅ Counted	✅ Added (5)
CASE... THEN 1 ELSE 0	All rows counted	Adds up only 1s
🧠 Final Tip for Interviews

    🗣 “I use COUNT(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 END) when I want to count how many rows meet a condition, and SUM(CASE WHEN condition THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) when I want to build logic into numeric totals.”

Would you like me to generate:

✅ A practice SQL sheet with SUM vs COUNT
✅ Visual diagram (infographic-style)
✅ Flashcards with common interview patterns

Let me know, bro, I got you 💪
